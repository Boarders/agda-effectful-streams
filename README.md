An attempt (not very successful) to think through some of the ideas presented [here](https://bentnib.org/posts/2012-01-06-streams.html). Some of the motivation was both how to deal with non-positive recursion (via yoneda) and keep track of the resources a stream or reader has remaining. Unfortunately this approach doesn't seem to easily generalise to a more generic setting (abstracting on the shape of the stream type).
